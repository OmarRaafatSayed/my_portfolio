    content: `### 1. Introduction
With so many AI model options available today, it can be hard to know which one is the best fit for your startup or project. Broad “flagship” large language models (LLMs) excel at general-purpose tasks, reasoning models shine when you need transparent, step-by-step logic, and research agents automate end-to-end information gathering and analysis. This post will help you understand the strengths of each category, when to choose them, and how to get the most out of each approach.

### 2. Overview of Model Categories
- Flagship LLMs — Pre-trained, general-purpose language models like GPT-4 or Claude 3.
- Reasoning Models — Variants of LLMs optimised for explicit chain-of-thought reasoning.
- Research Agents — Agent frameworks that automate multi-step research workflows.

### 3. When to Choose a Flagship LLM
Use Cases
- Creative content generation (blogs, social posts, ad copy)
- Conversational interfaces and customer support bots
- Simple transformations (translation, paraphrasing, summarisation)

Why It Fits
- Instant launch with no extra infrastructure
- High fluency and versatility
- Easy API integration for rapid prototyping

Best Practices
- Craft clear prompts describing goal, tone, and length.
- Control creativity via temperature & max_tokens.
- Few-shot examples to guide style and format.

### 4. When to Choose a Reasoning Model
Use Cases
- Multi-step logic or math problems
- Structured plans or decision trees
- Legal or academic text analysis with transparent reasoning

Why It Fits
- Chain-of-thought improves accuracy on complex tasks
- Lower error rates in reasoning-heavy scenarios
- Intermediate steps aid validation

How to Activate Reasoning
- Prompt for steps: “Explain your reasoning step by step.”
- Lower temperature for consistent logic.
- Benchmark and iterate on prompt phrasing.

 5. When to Choose a Research Agent
Use Cases
- Automated literature reviews or competitive intelligence
- Periodic monitoring with summary reports
- Multi-stage analysis: fetch → summarise → extract insights → cite

Why It Fits
- Coordinates multiple actions in a reusable workflow
- Integrates external APIs and databases
- Produces structured outputs with references

Setup Steps
- Design the workflow (Fetch → Summarise → Analyse → Cite)
- Implement custom actions/API calls
- Test end-to-end on a sample dataset
- Deploy, monitor, and refine

### 6. Quick Comparison
| Criterion | Flagship LLM | Reasoning Model | Research Agent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Ease of Launch | Very high | Medium | Low–Medium |
| Logical Transparency | Limited | High | High |
| External Data Integration | Basic | Basic | Advanced |
| Technical Effort | Low | Medium | High |

### 7. Practical Steps to Select the Right Model
1. Define the core task – open-ended text, logic, or research?
2. Prototype fast with a flagship LLM first.
3. Test reasoning if logic failures appear.
4. Plan an agent for data-heavy workflows.
5. Measure accuracy, latency, cost.
6. Iterate & scale with monitoring and alerts.

### 8. Conclusion
Choosing between a flagship LLM, a reasoning model, or a research agent boils down to task complexity and workflow. Start with a general LLM for speed, move to a reasoning model for transparent multi-step logic, and build a research agent to automate end-to-end information workflows. Follow a clear evaluation process to maximise value and minimise waste.`
